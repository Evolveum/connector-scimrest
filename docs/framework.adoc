= Framework Operations



== `executeQuery` Operation

The framework will look up correct handler (SCIM or REST with concrete configuration) based on following criteria:

* Object Class
* Filter
* OperationOptions

The returned handler then will be used to fetch and convert data. Supported base handlers for fetching data
are SCIM or REST.

NOTE: This is to account for possibility that some filters / searches may require completely different processing
      (eg. unable to search via SCIM, but able to search via REST) or fetching group first, then fetching user details
